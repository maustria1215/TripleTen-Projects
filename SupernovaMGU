**# Supernova MGU**

This was my externship project, which I worked on after graduating from the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a team project designed to help a real-world company, Supernova, analyze data, including Premiums, Declining Rates, Large Language Model accuracy, and provide a Quote Journey Analysis to their stakeholders.
