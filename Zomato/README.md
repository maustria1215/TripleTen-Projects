5. 'users' table

### Description:
- Tableau workbook. Includes 4 visualizations and one dashboard.
- .pdf report including my findings and recommendations.
- .pdf project decomposition.

### Process:
First I created the decomposition to propose my course of analysis for the project.
After the decomposition was approved, I reviewed and cleaned the data.
I created a relation between the users and orders Excel sheets in Tableau.
I created visualizations to show the relationships between the sum of sales and different customer characteristics.
I created a dashboard to summarize my findings.
Lastly, I wrote my report with my findings and recommendations for the client.
