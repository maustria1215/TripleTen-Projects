# **Supernova**

This externship project, which I worked on after graduating from the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program, was a team project designed to help a real-world company, Supernova, analyze different types of data, including Premiums, Decline Rates, Large Language Models Accuracy, and provide a Quote Journey Analysis.
