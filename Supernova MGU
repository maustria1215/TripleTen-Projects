# Supernova MGU

This was my externship project, which I worked on after graduating from the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a team project designed to help a real-world company, Supernova, better analyze data through Tableau dashboards, improving data visualization and user experience for Supernova's stakeholders.

# eCommerce Cohorts

In this project, I analyze raw transaction logs to turn event logs into business metrics by creating a conversion funnel, preparing the data for cohort analysis and calculating retention rates.
