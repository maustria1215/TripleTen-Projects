Supernova MGU

This was my externship project, which I worked on after graduating from the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a team project designed to help a real-world company, Supernova, better analyze data through Tableau dashboards, improving data visualization and user experience for Supernova's stakeholders.
